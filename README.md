Hello! If you are reading this or downloaded the projects, thanks for taking an interest! Not much to say here. I will say though I used VS Code and Icarus to program my verilog projects. 
I am sure most of these projects look trivial, but I wanted to get a strong understanding of verilog/system verilog and working from the ground up seemed like a good idea.

Anyways take a look around, and take care!
